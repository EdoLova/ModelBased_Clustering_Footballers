- **Model-based clustering** in R  
- **Dimensionality reduction:** PCA and UMAP  
- Data cleaning, normalization, and standardization

## Main Results
- **9 clusters** representing different player profiles (e.g., Playmaker, Marker, Dribbler, Chance Creator, etc.)  
- Identification of **hybrid players** belonging to multiple clusters
